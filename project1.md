description: "In this SITE 1101 team project, students explore how [computer hardware](/lectures/site-1101-lecture-notes-04/) works by physically building and testing basic digital logic. The project focuses on constructing NOT, AND, and OR [logic gates](/lectures/site-1101-lecture-notes-03/) from scratch using transistors, resistors, LEDs, and a breadboard in our beautiful lab room B012 managed by our great lab coordination [Nariman Vahabli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nariman-vahabli-856970251). Bonus tasks extend learning by combining gates to create NAND and XOR logic through collaboration. Below are some of the finest videos by students."
