description: "In this SITE 1101 team project, students explore how [computer hardware](/lectures/site-1101-lecture-notes-04/) works by physically building and testing basic digital logic. The project focuses on constructing NOT, AND, and OR [logic gates](/lectures/site-1101-lecture-notes-03/) from scratch using transistors, resistors, LEDs, and a breadboard in our beautiful lab room B012. Bonus tasks extend learning by combining gates to create NAND and XOR logic through collaboration. Below are some of the finest videos by students."
