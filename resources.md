## Policies and Resources
ADA University has her university-wide policy documents. You are expected to carefully study at least the following short documents: Honor Code and Student Code of Conduct. You should also be aware of the Student Assessment Regulations. If you have strong reasons to disagree with the grade you got, you should follow the procedures written in Student Academic Grievance Policy. 

Students with special needs or with chronic health issues are strongly recommended to contact the University’s Student Academic Support Services. ADA University provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with documented disabilities. Any student who feels she/he may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should notify the Office of Disability Services and Inclusive Education about his/her needs before the start of the academic term. Please contact Office of Student Services at phone: (012) 4373235 x226 or by email: studentservices@ada.edu.az

Reasonable accommodation is possible for students’ religious beliefs, observations, and practices or for foreseeable conflicts because of athletic competition.
Adjusting to student life, pursuing academic and personal goals can be emotionally stressful and challenging. Students are encouraged to make individual appointments with a Counselor to receive professional psychological support. Please contact Turana Aliyeva, Instructor at the School of Education at phone: (012) 4373235 x297 or by email: taliyeva@ada.edu.az
