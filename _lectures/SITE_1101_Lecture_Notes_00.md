## 1. System and Control System

A **system** is a set of interrelated components working together toward a common goal by accepting inputs, processing them, and producing outputs.  
A **control system** continuously monitors outputs and uses feedback to adjust inputs or processes, maintaining the system’s desired performance and stability.

- **Input:** The resources (data, materials, or energy) that enter the system.  
- **Process:** The transformation mechanism that converts input into output.  
- **Output:** The result produced by the system.  
- **Feedback:** Information about system performance used to make adjustments.

### Example 1 — Home Heating System

- **Input:** Desired room temperature  
- **Process:** Furnace heats the air  
- **Output:** Warm air circulating through the house  
- **Feedback:** Thermostat senses the temperature and switches the furnace on or off to maintain it.

### Example 2 — Brooklyn Bridge Engineering

In the mid-19th century, several European suspension bridges failed due to weak materials and poor system design.  
When **John Roebling** proposed the **Brooklyn Bridge**, he applied *engineering systems thinking* to overcome these problems.

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Input** | Industrial materials (steel cables, stone, concrete) and human expertise |
| **Process** | Design, testing, construction using pneumatic caissons, ongoing feedback adjustments |
| **Output** | A stable bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn |
| **Feedback** | Design improvements and safety checks during construction |

Roebling’s bridge illustrates how subsystems and feedback loops contribute to **system resilience** — even if one part fails, others sustain the overall stability.

## 2. Engineering and Technology

- **Engineering** (*Latin: ingenium — cleverness*)  
  → The creative application of scientific principles to design, build, operate, and predict the behavior of structures, machines, or processes safely and efficiently.

- **Technology** (*Greek: techne + logia — skill + study*)  
  → The application of techniques, skills, methods, and processes to produce goods, deliver services, or achieve goals.

## 3. Data, Information, and Knowledge

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Data** | Raw facts or figures without context | “30”, “32”, “31” |
| **Information** | Processed data with meaning | “Temperatures recorded: 30°C, 32°C, 31°C.” |
| **Knowledge** | Insight gained by interpreting information | “Since temps above 30°C increase evaporation, watering plants early morning is better.” |

## 4. Context

**Context** is the background or situation that gives meaning to data or events.  
It helps us interpret facts correctly by linking them to circumstances.

**Example:**  
Numbers like *1, 4, 9, 16, 25* may seem like perfect squares.  
But if they represent *ice cream sales over five days*, the context changes their meaning.

## 5. Information Systems

An **information system** is a set of interrelated components that collect, process, store, and disseminate data and information.  
It provides **feedback** to monitor and control its operation, ensuring that it meets its goals and objectives.

**Example:**  
A **library information system**:
- Input → Book data entered  
- Process → Organizing and cataloging  
- Output → Search results for users  
- Feedback → Record updates after borrowing

## 6. Computer-Based Information Systems (CBIS)

A **CBIS** is composed of:

- Hardware  
- Software  
- Databases  
- Telecommunications  
- People  
- Procedures  

These elements work together to collect, manipulate, store, and process data into useful information.

**Example:**  
An **online banking system** takes transaction requests as input, processes them securely, outputs updated balances, and uses feedback (like user confirmations or errors) to improve performance.
