# 🎓 SITE 1101: Principles of Information Systems

The course provides a general overview of what SITE students of the [ADA University](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/about/ada-university) will study throughout their bachelor’s program. It introduces the fundamentals of information technology and computer-based systems, including hardware, software, network, database, artificial intelligence, system analysis and design, programming, etc. The course was originally developed by [Araz Yusubov](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/schools/site/members/faculty/58-araz-yusubov) and [Nuraddin Sadili](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/schools/site/members/faculty/76-nuraddin-sadili). 

## Fall 2025

This website is launched at the end of the Fall 2025 semester with the efforts of our great Teaching Assistants [Nilufar Ismayilova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilufar-ismayilova-24b7523a2), [Rahida Asadli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahidaasadli) (see [Lecture Notes](/lectures)), and [Rahman Karimov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahman-karimov-22444b25b) (Website), as well as the guidance of the course instructors [Rumiyya Alili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rumiyya-alili) and [Ismayil Shahaliyev](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/schools/site/members/faculty/72-ismayil-shahaliyev).

## Participation
Students are expected to review the material covered in class and come prepared for the next
session’s discussions. Participation will be encouraged through both general discussion
questions and individual questions directed to selected students.[^1] For **excused absences** (e.g. illnesses), a student must write an email with a document of proof to their advisor, who will inform the relevant instructors.

## Homeworks and Projects
The detailed instructions and grading criteria of homeworks and projects will be communicated
to students during the semester. Students are expected follow the instructions and submit their
assignments before the deadline. 

## Deadline Policy
Deadlines will never be extended. When submitting, a student must consider possible internet
connection issues, uploaded file size, etc. Late submissions of one minute until thirty minutes
will receive a 10% penalty, late submissions of thirty minutes until one day will receive a 25%
penalty with no claim for bonuses (if there are any), late submissions of more than one day will receive zero.

## Examination
You will have two exams: midterm and final. Both exams will be computer-based (unless noted
otherwise) with questions of various types (e.g. multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, code/essay). More specific rules will be communicated to you before the exam.[^2]

## Study Materials
Study materials will be shared with you on blackboard throughout the semester. [Lecture Notes](/lectures) are available online for this course.

## Policies & Resources

ADA University has her university-wide [policy documents](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/academics/policies). You are expected to carefully study at least the following short documents: [Honor Code](https://www.ada.edu.az/file_upload/policies/honor_code.pdf) and [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.ada.edu.az/file_upload/policies/student_code_conduct.pdf). You should also be aware of the [Student Assessment Regulations](https://www.ada.edu.az/file_upload/policies/stud_as_reg.pdf). If you have strong reasons to disagree with the grade you got, you should follow the procedures written in [Student Academic Grievance Policy](https://www.ada.edu.az/file_upload/policies/stud_acad_griev_policy.pdf). 

Students with **special needs** or with **chronic health issues** are strongly recommended to contact the University’s [Student Academic Support Services](https://www.ada.edu.az/en/experience/sass). ADA University provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with documented disabilities. Any student who feels (s)he may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should notify the Office of Disability Services and Inclusive Education about their needs before the start of the academic term.[^3]

Adjusting to student life, pursuing academic and personal goals can be emotionally stressful and challenging. Students are encouraged to make individual appointments with a Counselor to receive professional **psychological support**.

Students are encouraged to consult with the Writing Center for checking their papers and assignments. Please visit the center or contact them by email. Reasonable accommodation is possible for students’ religious beliefs, observations, and practices or for foreseeable conflicts because of athletic competition. Students with recurring or permanent internet and/or hardware problems are strongly recommended to contact the University’s IT Service Desk and/or the Blackboard Administrator.
